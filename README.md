This excersize was helpful for me. I feel like I can bang out a minimal Rails app really quickly now. The first time took me a while, although I wasn't keeping track of time. The last time only took me about 15 minutes (although it's very minimal). I feel like I basically have all the controller methods memorized so I can write those really quickly. I also realized that resources: creatures is a quick way for rails to write all the routes for you. (I hope that's not cheating.) The only thing that takes me some time is making all the views files.
